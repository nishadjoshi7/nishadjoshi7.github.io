[Prof. Pragya Gupta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pragya-gupta-5a807414/), Assistant Professor at K.J. Somaiya College of Engineering, Mumbai

"Nishad was a sincere and hardworking student. Over the four years of his B.Tech course at KJSCE, I taught him several theory and laboratory courses. Nishad's response in all laboratory sessions was remarkable. He is a diligent and brilliant student. I can vouch for his awesome managerial and leadership skills that he demonstrated during his tenure as General Secretary of The Student's Council. I would highly recommend him for his technical, managerial and interpersonal skills. And wish him all the best for his future. I am sure he will scale heights in his career and life!"
